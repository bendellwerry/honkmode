This is a simple Chromium browser extension that will replace the Clown react on Gab with the original Honkler react.<br>
<br>
<b>[Download here!](https://kyrbys.com/HonkMode.crx)</b>
<br><br>You may get an error 'CRX_REQUIRED_PROOF_MISSING' when you download the file. This is because this extension is not in the Chrome Web Store.<br><br>
After downloading, open your browsers extension page (usually something like chrome://extensions or brave://extensions) and then drag and drop the crx file above onto that page.<br>
<br>
Honk Mode is now activated! Enjoy!<br><br>
